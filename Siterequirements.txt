I am starting a vending company business. It is called Biscayne Vending and I already created the root folder. I want to use react native

General Rules
You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, and firebase.

This is my first coding project so you will need to be specific on what code needs to go where and change the code for me.

Code Style and Structure

	•	Write concise, technically sound TypeScript code, with accurate examples where necessary.
	•	Follow functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes and imperative code unless absolutely necessary.
	•	Prefer modularization and reuse of code over duplication, making the app more maintainable.
	•	Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs like isLoading, hasError, shouldFetch, etc.
	•	Structure files in an intuitive way:
	•	Main component
	•	Subcomponents
	•	Helper functions or utilities
	•	Static content (e.g., images, constants)
	•	Type definitions (interfaces, types).

Naming Conventions

	•	Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
	•	Prefer named exports over default exports for easier refactoring and tree shaking, making components easier to track across the project.

TypeScript Usage

	•	Write TypeScript for all code, leveraging type safety to catch potential errors early.
	•	Prefer interfaces over types unless union types or more complex compositions are needed (interfaces are better for object shapes and extending).
	•	Avoid using enums, instead opt for maps or string literal types for better flexibility and performance.
	•	Always use functional components, strongly typed with TypeScript interfaces for props.

Syntax and Formatting

	•	Use the function keyword for pure functions, particularly for utilities or helper functions.
	•	Simplify conditionals: Avoid unnecessary curly braces where concise syntax (like inline ternaries or logical operators) can improve readability. However, ensure readability is never sacrificed for brevity.
	•	Keep JSX declarative and expressive, favoring simplicity and clarity over cleverness.

Performance Optimization

	•	Optimize image handling:
	•	Use WebP format for improved performance.
	•	Always include size data (width and height) in image elements to prevent layout shifts (especially important for mobile performance).
	•	Implement lazy loading for images and other heavy content, using either native lazy loading (loading="lazy") or React libraries such as react-lazyload or IntersectionObserver.
Performance OptimizationImplement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
Optimize database queries for faster retrieval
Consider using a CDN for static assets

Logging rules:
Here is my rule of thumb: "Log what you'd need to debug the issue if you were woken up at 3 AM, but not more."
Use best practices when making logs, high signal low noise, should provide value without being overly verbose.

This guideline encourages thoughtful logging practices. 
Log critical errors: Always log errors that could crash the application or severely impact functionality.
Log unexpected behaviors: If something happens that shouldn't, it's worth logging.
Avoid logging normal operations: Don't log routine, or expected behaviors.
Use log levels: Implement DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels to categorize logs.
Be selective: Log the most relevant information that would help diagnose issues quickly.
Consider the context: Include enough contextual data to understand the error's circumstances.
Think about actionability: If you can't act on the information, it might not need to be logged.
Review and refine: Periodically review logs to see if they're providing value or just noise.

## Core Technologies
- Frontend: next.js React
- Backend: firebase
- Authentication: firebase
- Storage: Firebase backend/storage
- Key Management: env variables for app keys and sercrets, Firebase for user ai keys if applicable
- Payment Processing: Stripe
- Deployment: GitHub and Vercel


To start the project, I need to create a new react native project. And I want it to have a home page, a contact page, an about page, and a services page. We do not need to have a login or signup page for now. 

In everything we do, we need to optimize for seo. Please use the best practices for seo.

 The colors for my logo will be:
 Blue primary color: #0057ff
 Aqua secondary color (e.g. for button background): #def6f6
 White will be the background color.
